Running a Jupyter Notebook **on GitHub itself** is not possible — GitHub can *display* notebooks, but it cannot *execute* them.  
However, you **can** run a GitHub‑hosted notebook using several excellent tools that connect directly to your repo.

Let me walk you through the options, from simplest to most powerful.

---

# 🚀 **Option 1 — Run your GitHub notebook in Google Colab (easiest)**

Colab can open and run any `.ipynb` file stored on GitHub.

### **Steps**
1. Open **Google Colab**: https://colab.research.google.com  
2. Click **File → Open Notebook**  
3. Select the **GitHub** tab  
4. Paste your GitHub repo URL  
5. Choose the notebook you want to run  
6. Click **Open**

Colab will load the notebook and let you run it on free CPU/GPU.

# 🚀 **Option 2 — Run your GitHub notebook in Binder (no installation)**

Binder launches a temporary cloud environment that runs your notebook exactly as if it were local.

### **Steps**
1. Go to: https://mybinder.org  
2. Paste your GitHub repo URL  
3. Click **Launch**  
4. Binder builds a full environment and opens Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

This is great for demos, teaching, and reproducible environments.

# 🚀 **Option 3 — Run your GitHub notebook in VS Code (local)**

If you want to run the notebook on your own machine:

### **Steps**
1. Install **VS Code**  
2. Install the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions  
3. Clone your GitHub repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   ```
4. Open the repo folder in VS Code  
5. Open the `.ipynb` file  
6. Click **Run All** or run cells individually

This is the most flexible option for local development.

# 🚀 **Option 4 — Run your GitHub notebook in Jupyter Notebook (local Anaconda)**

Since you already use Anaconda, this will feel natural.

### **Steps**
1. Clone your repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the repo:
   ```
   cd yourrepo
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Click your `.ipynb` file in the browser window

---

# 🚀 **Option 5 — GitHub Codespaces (cloud VS Code)**

If your repo supports Codespaces:

### **Steps**
1. Go to your GitHub repo  
2. Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace**  
3. GitHub opens a cloud VS Code environment  
4. Open and run your notebook directly

This gives you a full Linux dev environment in the browser.

# 🎯 **Which option should you use, Tom?**

Given your setup (Windows + Anaconda + VS Code), the **VS Code** or **local Jupyter Notebook** options will feel the most natural.

If you want zero setup and instant execution, **Colab** or **Binder** is the fastest path.

If you want, I can walk you through:

- setting up VS Code for Jupyter  
- cloning your repo  
- fixing kernel issues  
- or running notebooks inside a conda environment  

Just tell me where you want to go next.
