Absolutely, Tom — here’s a clean, complete walkthrough for setting up **VS Code to run Jupyter notebooks**, written the way I’d explain it to a colleague who wants everything to “just work” the first time.

I’ll show each step, why it matters, and how to verify it’s working.

---

# 🧩 1. Install VS Code (if not already installed)

Download from the official site:

**https://code.visualstudio.com**

Install using all default options — especially:

- **Add to PATH**
- **Register as default editor for supported file types**

These make your life easier later.

---

# 🧩 2. Install the Required VS Code Extensions

Open VS Code → left sidebar → **Extensions** (square icon)

Search for and install:

### **1. Python (Microsoft)**
- Provides Python language support  
- Required for Jupyter notebooks to run

### **2. Jupyter (Microsoft)**
- Adds notebook support  
- Lets you run `.ipynb` files directly in VS Code  
- Provides cell execution, variable explorer, plots, etc.

### **3. (Optional) Jupyter Keymap + Jupyter Notebook Renderers**
These improve keyboard shortcuts and rendering.

Once installed, VS Code will prompt you to reload — do it.

---

# 🧩 3. Make Sure You Have Python Installed

Since you use Anaconda, you’re already set.

But VS Code needs to know **which Python interpreter** to use.

Open the Command Palette:

```
Ctrl + Shift + P
```

Type:

```
Python: Select Interpreter
```

Choose your Anaconda environment, usually something like:

```
(base) C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\python.exe
```

or whichever environment you want to run notebooks in.

---

# 🧩 4. Open Your GitHub Notebook

You can either:

### **A. Clone your GitHub repo**
Open a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
cd yourrepo
code .
```

or

### **B. Open the folder directly in VS Code**
File → Open Folder → select your repo folder.

Then open the `.ipynb` file.

VS Code will automatically detect it as a notebook.

---

# 🧩 5. Select the Jupyter Kernel

At the top right of the notebook, you’ll see:

```
Select Kernel
```

Click it and choose the same Python interpreter you selected earlier.

This ensures:

- imports work  
- conda packages load correctly  
- the notebook runs in the right environment  

---

# 🧩 6. Run a Cell

Click the **Run** button (triangle icon) next to any cell.

Or use:

```
Shift + Enter
```

If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see:

- execution count `[1]`  
- output below the cell  
- variables appearing in the **Variable Explorer** (top right)

This confirms your Jupyter environment is working.

---

# 🧩 7. Install Missing Packages (if needed)

If a cell errors with “module not found,” install packages into your environment:

```
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

or

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

VS Code will automatically pick them up.

---

# 🧩 8. Optional: Enable Interactive Window

If you prefer a MATLAB‑style workflow:

- Open a `.py` file  
- Add `# %%` to create a cell  
- Run it with **Run Cell**

VS Code opens a Jupyter‑style interactive window.

---

# 🎉 At this point, you’re fully set up

You can now:

- Run GitHub notebooks locally  
- Edit and save `.ipynb` files  
- Use plots, variable explorer, and debugging  
- Switch kernels and environments  
- Mix Python scripts and notebooks seamlessly  

---

If you want, Tom, I can also help you:

- Set up a dedicated conda environment for Jupyter  
- Fix kernel issues (very common)  
- Sync notebooks between GitHub and VS Code  
- Convert `.ipynb` ↔ `.py`  
- Use VS Code’s remote development features  

Just tell me what direction you want to go.
